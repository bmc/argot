# Abandonware Alert!

**THIS PROJECT IS DEAD. I will no longer be maintaining it.
[scopt](https://github.com/scopt/scopt) does everything you'd need
in a command-line options parser, and it's what I'll be using going
forward.**

## Old Description

Argot is a command-line parser library for [Scala][], supporting:

* single-value and multi-value options
* single-value and multi-value parameters
* flag and non-flag options
* GNU-style long options, i.e., "--option")
* POSIX-style short options, i.e., single "-" lead-in, with option
  grouping (e.g., "`tar -xcf foo.tgz`")
* automatic parameter conversion (i.e., values with non-string types,
  with automatic conversion)
* the ability to supply your own conversion functions

For more information, see the [Argot home page][].

**NOTE**: The `master` branch supports only Scala 2.10 and later. See
the [`pre-scala-2.10`](https://github.com/bmc/argot/tree/pre-scala-2.10)
branch for versions of Scala prior to 2.10.
